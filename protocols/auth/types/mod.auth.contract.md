# mod.auth.contract

A grant from one identity (the issuer) to another (the subject), authorising
the subject to perform a set of actions on the issuer's behalf until a given
expiry time. A contract on its own carries no signatures; once co-signed by
the issuer and the subject it becomes a `mod.auth.signed_contract` and can
be indexed by the `auth` module.

## Fields

* Issuer (identity) – Identity granting the permissions.
* Subject (identity) – Identity receiving the permissions.
* Permits ([mod.auth.permit]) – List of permits granted by this contract.
* ExpiresAt (time) – Time at which the contract stops being active.

A contract grants an action if any of its permits matches the action's
object type and the action's constraint evaluation (if any) accepts the
permit's `Constraints` bundle.

The signable form of a contract is the human-readable string
`<issuer> grants <subject> permissions until <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>`, used
when signing with text-only schemes (e.g. `bip137`); binary schemes
(e.g. `asn1`) sign the contract's object ID.
