# mod.auth.signed_contract

A `mod.auth.contract` co-signed by its issuer and subject. Both signatures
must verify against the corresponding identities before the auth module will
index the contract or consult it when authorizing actions.

## Fields

* Contract (mod.auth.contract) – The embedded contract being signed.
* IssuerSig (mod.crypto.signature) – Signature produced with the issuer's private key.
* SubjectSig (mod.crypto.signature) – Signature produced with the subject's private key.

Both signatures cover the same contract; each may use a different signature
scheme (e.g. `asn1` over the contract's object ID, or `bip137` over its
human-readable signable text).
