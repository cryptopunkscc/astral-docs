# mod.ether.broadcast

The unsigned body of an ether broadcast: a single object announced to the broadcast network, tagged with who sent it and when. Wrap it in `mod.ether.signed_broadcast` before sending.

## Fields

* Timestamp (time) – When the broadcast was created.
* Source ([`Identity`](../../../core-definitions/identity.md)) – Identity of the node that originated the broadcast.
* Object (object) – The announced payload; any astral object type. On the wire it is length-prefixed (bytes16) and holds the object encoded in its generic form (type + payload).
