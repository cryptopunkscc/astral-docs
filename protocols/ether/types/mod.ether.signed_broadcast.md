# mod.ether.signed_broadcast

A `mod.ether.broadcast` body paired with a signature over it. `mod.ether.signed_broadcast` is the form actually sent on the broadcast network; receivers reject any datagram whose signature is absent or does not verify.

## Fields

* Broadcast (`mod.ether.broadcast`) – The embedded broadcast body: the timestamp, source identity, and announced object.
* Signature (`mod.crypto.signature`) – Signature produced with the source's node key over the object ID of the embedded broadcast body. It covers the body only, not the signature field itself.
