# indexing.subscribe

Deliver pending index changes to a registered indexer identified by `nonce`. The op streams an `indexing.index` or `indexing.unindex` message for each pending change, waits for the caller to acknowledge each with an `indexing.ack`, then advances the indexer's stored state. When the indexer is caught up the op blocks until a new change arrives or the context is cancelled. Delivery is retried with exponential back-off (1 s initial, 1 min cap, factor 2) when the caller signals `ErrIndexingTemporarilyFailed`.

## Arguments

* Nonce (nonce64, required) – Nonce identifying the registered indexer.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if the nonce does not identify a known indexer, or a fatal error occurs.
* An `indexing.index` object when an object has been added to a repo.
* An `indexing.unindex` object when an object has been removed from a repo.

The caller must respond to each delivered change with an `indexing.ack`. The op returns an `error_message` if the ack's `Repo` or `Version` does not match the delivered change.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query indexing.subscribe -Nonce 0102030405060708 -out json
{"Type":"indexing.index","Object":{"Repo":"myrepo","Version":1,"ObjectID":"<object-id>"}}
{"Type":"indexing.index","Object":{"Repo":"myrepo","Version":2,"ObjectID":"<object-id>"}}
```
