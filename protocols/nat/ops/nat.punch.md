# nat.punch

Drive the initiator side of a NAT hole-punch against a target identity and register the resulting hole. The node resolves its own public IPv4 address and the target identity, then runs the offer/answer/ready/go/result exchange with the target's `nat.node_punch` operation. The operation fails if the node has no suitable public IPv4 address, if the target identity cannot be resolved, or if any step of the punch does not complete.

## Arguments

* Target (string, required) – The peer to punch to, given as a hex public key or alias resolved via the directory.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if the local IP or target identity cannot be resolved, or the punch fails.
* A single `nat.hole` object describing the connected endpoint pair on success.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query nat.punch -Target 02c4d3b2a1908f7e6d5c4b3a29180706f5e4d3c2b1a09f8e7d6c5b4a39281706f5 -out json
