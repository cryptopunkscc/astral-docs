# nat.hole

A pair of connected UDP endpoints resulting from a successful hole-punch, one held by the active (initiating) peer and one by the passive (responding) peer.

## Fields

* Nonce (nonce64) – Identifier of the hole, unique within the pool that holds it.
* ActiveIdentity ([`Identity`](../../../core-definitions/identity.md)) – The peer that initiated the punch.
* ActiveEndpoint (`nat.endpoint`) – The active peer's public UDP endpoint.
* PassiveIdentity ([`Identity`](../../../core-definitions/identity.md)) – The peer that responded to the punch.
* PassiveEndpoint (`nat.endpoint`) – The passive peer's public UDP endpoint.
* CreatedAt (time) – The moment the hole was created.
