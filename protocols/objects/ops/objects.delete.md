# objects.delete

Delete an object (or a stream of objects) from a repository.

## Arguments

* repo (string8, required) – Repository to delete from. There is no default repository for delete.
* id (object_id.sha256) – Id to delete. If omitted, the operation streams ids from the input.
* zone (zone) – Zone filter for the delete context. Defaults to all zones.
* out (string8) – Output format.
* (stream) – When `id` is omitted, a stream of `object_id.sha256` objects to delete; `ack` and `eos` are ignored.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if the repository is not found, the delete fails, or a protocol error occurs.
* An `ack` object for each successful delete (one shot if `id` was given, otherwise one per streamed id).

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query objects.delete -repo local -id data1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa -out json
{"Type":"ack","Object":null}
```
