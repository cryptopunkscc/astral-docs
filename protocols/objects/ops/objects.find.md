# objects.find

Find identities that can provide a given object.

## Arguments

* id (object_id.sha256, required) – The id to look up.
* zone (zone) – Zone filter for finder lookups. Defaults to all zones.
* out (string8) – Output format.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if `id` is missing/zero or the lookup fails.
* A stream of `identity` objects (deduplicated by string form) followed by an `eos` object. The lookup context has a one-minute timeout.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query objects.find -id data1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa -out json
{"Type":"identity","Object":"02bef8840eb35ef2ae3c83c07cb5779278904f99cb4103f71e37cc69931ae5e15f"}
{"Type":"eos","Object":null}
```
