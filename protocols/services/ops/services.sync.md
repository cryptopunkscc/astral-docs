# services.sync

Fetch and store service advertisements from a remote identity, updating the local service registry. In follow mode the sync runs continuously until any data is received on the channel. The channel is cancelled as soon as any input arrives.

## Arguments

* id (string) – Target identity to sync from, given as a hex public key or alias resolved via the directory.
* follow (bool) – If true, continue syncing until the channel receives input. Defaults to false.
* in (string8) – Input format.
* out (string8) – Output format.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if the target identity cannot be resolved or the sync fails.
* An `ack` object on success.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query services.sync -id 037f990e61acee8a7697966afd29dd88f3b1f8a7b14d625c4f8742bd952003a590 -out json
