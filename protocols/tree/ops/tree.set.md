# tree.set

Set the value at a path. The value is passed as a typed object via the input stream.

## Arguments

* path (string8, required) – The path to write.
* Type (string) – The object type name to use when parsing `Value`; inferred from the node's current value if empty.
* Value (string) – The text-encoded value to store. Defaults to empty; when empty the op enters streaming mode and reads typed objects from the input stream.
* (stream) – A typed object to store at the path; consumed only when `Value` is empty.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `error_message` object if there was an error.
* An `ack` object if the value was stored successfully.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ echo '{"Type":"bool","Object":false}' | astral-query tree.set -path /mod/tcp/settings/listen -in json -out json
{"Type":"ack","Object":null}
```

```shellsession
$ echo '{"Type":"string8","Object":"hello"}' | astral-query tree.set -path /tmp/mykey -in json -out json
{"Type":"ack","Object":null}
```

```shellsession
$ astral-query tree.set -path /tmp/mykey -Type string8 -Value hello -out json
{"Type":"ack","Object":null}
```
