# user.remove_asset

Remove an object from the user's asset list. The change is logged as a
removal (tombstone) so other nodes pick it up via `user.sync_assets`, and a
`mod.user.notification` with event `assets` is pushed to all linked siblings.

## Arguments

* id (object_id, required) – ID of the object to remove.

## Returned objects

The operation returns one of:
* An `ack` if the asset was removed.
* Rejected with the internal-error code if the database write failed.

## Examples

```shellsession
$ astral-query user.remove_asset -id id1.... -out text
#[ack]
```
