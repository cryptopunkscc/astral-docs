# apphost IPC protocol

The astral node exposes an IPC surface (`mod/apphost`) that lets local
processes route outbound queries through the node and serve inbound queries
targeting an identity the process owns. This document specifies the wire
protocol.

## Transport

The host listens on one or more endpoints of the form `<proto>:<addr>`. The
defaults are:

| Endpoint                | Notes                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `tcp:127.0.0.1:8625`    | loopback TCP                           |
| `unix:~/.apphost.sock`  | unix domain socket                     |

All endpoints carry the same protocol. A guest opens a fresh connection per
session; a session is one outbound query, one service registration, or one
inbound-query attach.

## Framing

The IPC protocol uses a binary [channel](../core-primitives/channel.md) for
messages.

## Session handshake

1. Guest connects. Host sends `mod.apphost.host_info_msg{Identity, Alias}` —
   the node's identity and local alias.
2. *(optional)* Guest sends `mod.apphost.auth_token_msg{Token}`. Host replies
   with `mod.apphost.auth_success_msg{GuestID}` on success or
   `mod.apphost.error_msg{auth_failed}` on failure.

After step 1 the guest is *anonymous*; after a successful step 2 the session
is bound to `GuestID`. Anonymous guests:

- may send queries only if the host's `AllowAnonymous` config is on (default);
- have the network zone (`ZoneNetwork`) stripped from their queries;
- may not register handlers.

The guest may then send exactly one of `RouteQueryMsg`, `RegisterServiceMsg`,
or `AttachQueryMsg` (the last only on a fresh sub-connection answering an
`IncomingQueryMsg`). Any other top-level message yields
`error_msg{protocol_error}` and connection close.

## Sending queries

```
guest → host:  mod.apphost.route_query_msg {
                 Nonce:   Nonce,
                 Caller:  Identity,         // may be zero
                 Target:  Identity,
                 Query:   String16,
                 Zone:    Zone,             // dvn / device / network / virtual
                 Filters: []String8,        // optional
               }
host  → guest: one of:
                 mod.apphost.query_accepted_msg {}
                 mod.apphost.query_rejected_msg { Code: Uint8 }
                 mod.apphost.error_msg         { Code: String8 }
```

Caller authorization:

- zero `Caller` → anonymous;
- `Caller == GuestID` → allowed;
- otherwise the guest must hold a `SudoAction` for `Caller`, else
  `error_msg{denied}`.

Error codes returned for `route_query`: `route_not_found`,
`target_not_allowed`, `canceled`, `timeout`, `internal_error`, `denied`.

On `query_accepted_msg` the connection ceases to be a message channel and
becomes the **raw bidirectional bytestream of the accepted query**. Both
endpoints write/read query bytes directly; the session ends when either side
closes the connection. One query per connection.

A query in flight can be cancelled by opening a separate session and routing
`apphost.cancel?id=<Nonce>` to the host.

## Receiving queries

There are two ways to register as a handler for an identity. Both require an
authenticated session and the same authorization: the registered identity
must equal `GuestID`, or the guest must hold a `SudoAction` for it.

### A. Register-service (push notifications on the registration conn)

```
guest → host:  mod.apphost.register_service_msg { Identity }
host  → guest: astral.ack                       (or error_msg{denied})
```

The registration connection stays open. For each inbound query targeting
`Identity`, the host pushes:

```
host → guest: mod.apphost.incoming_query_msg {
                QueryID: Nonce,
                Caller:  Identity,
                Target:  Identity,
                Query:   String16,
              }
```

Within `QueryAttachTimeout` (5 s) the guest must do one of:

- **Accept** — open a *new* IPC connection, complete the handshake (no
  `AuthTokenMsg` needed: `QueryID` is the pairing token), and send:

  ```
  guest → host: mod.apphost.attach_query_msg { QueryID }
  host  → guest: astral.ack       (or error_msg{route_not_found} if QueryID
                                   is unknown/expired)
  ```

  After the `Ack` this connection becomes the raw bytestream of the inbound
  query, with the guest as responder.

- **Reject** — send on the *registration* conn:

  ```
  guest → host: mod.apphost.reject_incoming_msg { QueryID, Code: Uint8 }
  ```

  The caller observes `query_rejected_msg{Code}`.

- **Ignore** — after the timeout the caller observes `route_not_found`.

Closing the registration connection unregisters the handler.

### B. Register-handler (host dials a guest-side IPC endpoint)

The guest issues a normal `route_query` to the host with method
`apphost.register_handler`:

```
Query: "apphost.register_handler?endpoint=<proto>:<addr>&token=<Nonce>"
```

On `query_accepted_msg` the host sends `astral.ack` over the resulting
bytestream and registers the handler. The host keeps the handler in its
registry; the original query conn is closed.

For each inbound query targeting `GuestID`, the host **dials `endpoint` as a
fresh IPC connection** and sends:

```
host    → handler: mod.apphost.handle_query_msg {
                     IpcToken: Nonce,         // == registered token
                     ID:       Nonce,         // query nonce
                     Caller:   Identity,
                     Target:   Identity,
                     Query:    String16,
                   }
handler → host:    one of:
                     astral.ack                         (accept)
                     mod.apphost.query_rejected_msg { Code: Uint8 }
                     mod.apphost.error_msg          { Code: String8 }
                     (or close) ─────────────────────── route_not_found to caller
```

On `Ack` the dialed connection becomes the raw bytestream for that query.
The handler must therefore listen on `endpoint` (any `tcp` / `unix` / `memu`
/ `memb` address it owns) before registering.

Lifecycle:

- A failed dial removes the handler from the registry.
- For explicit, immediate cleanup the guest may open a session, route
  `apphost.bind`, send `mod.apphost.bind_msg{Token}` on the resulting
  bytestream, and keep that bind connection open. When the bind connection
  closes, every handler registered with that `Token` is removed.
