# Codec

* The `Codec` writes and reads `Objects` as a type tag followed by the
  `Payload`. The tag is produced by a `Type Encoder` chosen by the caller;
  the `Payload` follows the [Binary Encoding](binary-encoding.md) rules.
* The decoder resolves the `Object Type` to a zero `Object` through a
  [Blueprints](blueprints.md) registry and calls `ReadFrom` on it.
* The `Codec` described here is the binary framing layer. `JSON` and
  `Text` encodings define their own framing — see
  [JSON Encoding](json-encoding.md) and [Text Encoding](text-encoding.md).

## Type Encoders

| Encoder     | Tag bytes                                                          | Notes                                                                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Short`     | `Object Type` ([`string8`](../common-types/string8.md))            | Used by framed channels and nested polymorphic fields.                                  |
| `Canonical` | `Stamp \|\| Object Type (string8)`                                 | Used for `Object ID` hashing and out-of-band transport. Rejects an empty `Object Type`. |
| `Indexed`   | [`uint8`](../common-types/uint8.md) index                          | Used by protocols with a closed type table known to both parties.                       |

## Canonical Form

* The `Canonical Form` of a `Typed Object` is the byte sequence used to
  compute its [`Object ID`](../core-primitives/object-id.md) and to
  express it outside any framing.
* It is the `Canonical Type Encoder`'s output: `Stamp` followed by the
  `Object Type` as a `string8` followed by the `Payload`.

```
   41 44 43 30                Stamp (0x41444330)
   06 75 69 6e 74 33 32       Object Type "uint32" (string8)
   00 00 00 2a                Payload (uint32 = 42)
```
